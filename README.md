This repository contains ROS2 wrappers around the acquire drivers, allowing seamless integration of acquire camera and storage drivers into ROS2-based projects.

## Build instructions
Of course, you must have [ROS2 installed](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Installation.html), and [a workspace created](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Colcon-Tutorial.html#create-a-workspace) into which you will clone this repo.  Build using colcon as directed in the workspace link.

Package-specific instructions are in the README files of the packages.
